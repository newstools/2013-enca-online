DURBAN – South Africa’s oldest teacher, Nontsikelelo Qwelane, says she has no intention of downing the chalk just yet. 92-year-old Qwelane has been teaching for 73 years and she still remains dedicated to her profession. She teaches grade 12 Geography at Metropolitan College in Mpumalanga. Despite her age, Qwelane has the same amount of commitment as she did 73 years ago and does not plan to slow down. “We are very busy inside school there is no time for walking as if you are a flat tyre there. I&39;m telling you. We are very busy and our results are good,” she said. Qwelane is critical of some of today’s teachers, saying they are not as hard-working as teachers were when she started. But she said she has noticed a change for the good. “I don&39;t blame them so much because some of them are people who were trained during apartheid. But now there&39;s an awakening, they are really beginning to be the teachers I used to know,” said Qwelane.
