A screen shot from cellphone footage shows a Grade 8 learner assaulting a teacher at Glenvista High School, south of Johannesburg. In this shot the teacher can be seen fending off an attempted beating by the boy who is brandishing a broom. JOHANNESBURG - The Glenvista High School pupil accused of assaulting his teacher will reappear in the Johannesburg Children’s Court on Tuesday. The grade eight pupil was caught on camera assaulting a male teacher on September 18. He first appeared at the same court on September 23 on a charge of assault laid by the 55-year-old male teacher seen in the video. SAPS spokesperson Sibongile Mnguni said the accused was released into the care of a parent and he is expected back in court on Tuesday morning. Meanwhile, a Jim Fouche Primary School pupil will appear in the school’s disciplinary committee for violent conduct on the same day. The 14-year-old is accused of punching a female teacher in the face last week. The pupil was immediately suspended after the incident. Basic Education Department condemned the attack and hopes proper measures will be implemented by the school’s disciplinary committee. “The department condemns any form of violent behaviour in schools. The incident is currently being handled by Jim Fouche Primary School’s disciplinary desk but the department will follow the matter closely hoping that proper action is taken against the accused,” said education spokesperson Gershwin Chuenyane. Brixton police spokesperson Sarah Khumalo said no criminal charges have been laid against the pupil.
