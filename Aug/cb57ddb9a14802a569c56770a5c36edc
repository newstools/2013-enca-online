A burnt-down bottle store in Fochville on 06 August 2013. Residents in the area had been protesting over a housing backlog in Kokosi township. FOCHVILLE - Gauteng MEC for Community Safety Nonhlanhla Faith Mazibuko had to be escorted out of Kokosi township in Fochville after protesters threw stones at her. She was in the area to speak to residents about their concerns, following a service delivery protest that started on Monday. Kokosi residents say the main source of their frustrations is a housing backlog that residents claims dates back to 1994. The protest has turned chaotic, with protesters yesterday burning down several houses belonging to local councillors. Protesters also set cars alight and looted shops yesterday, forcing foreign shop-owners to flee the area. Police used rubbers bullets in an attempt to control the crowds. Protesters have now threatened to set more houses alight, and are demanding that dozens of demonstrators who were arrested yesterday be released. A representative of the provincial legislature, Nompi Nhlapho, blamed drawn-out negotations with landowners for the housing backlog. Economic Freedom Fighters members, led by Kenny Kunene, have also visited the township to speak to residents. Have a look here for a gallery of images from Day 2 of the protests.
