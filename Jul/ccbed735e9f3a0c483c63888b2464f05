DURBAN - An elderly couple in their 60s, has spoken out about the challenges they have faced as lesbians. Having spent more than 13 years together, the couple from KawZulu-Natal has been on the receiving end of many insults and rude stares. But, today, they have taken to encouraging other gay couples not to be ashamed of who they are. Thokozile Menziwa is a happily-married grandmother, even though her choice of partner Mkhulu Menziwa has raised many eyebrows during their years together. Thokozile Menziwa said, “People worry more about what is happening in the night when we&39;re sleeping [and] what we&39;re doing and we tell them that is personal. I don&39;t ask you how you sleep with your wife.” The small township of Waterloo, north of Durban, is home to the Menziwas and it is also where they feel the most comfortable. Most in the community have come to accept the couple and find nothing unusual about the relationship. With time, they have learned public opinion is not important but religion and a healthy relationship are.
